# A script to parse git log output and generate a list of PRs that have been merged.
# Useful for PR descriptions when merging in changes from nucore-open.
# This is also a dependency of the release_describer script.
#
# Usage:
# Compare your current branch to master:
# bin/merge_describer
#
# Compare your current branch to a tag:
# bin/merge_describer v2024-06-18
target_branch=${1:-master}
