# frozen_string_literal: true

# Include this module in one of your models to support asynchronous file processing
# via ActiveJob. It will only allow one instance of the model to be in process at
# a time.
#
# Requirements:
# * Model must have `status`, `processed_at`, and `error_message` columns, and
#   should have "processing" as the default for the `status` column
#   `add_column :status, default: "processing", null: false
# * Model must implement `process_file!` (see `FileProcessingJob`)
#   * `process_file!` should raise an error if anything goes wrong
#
# Example:
# class OrderImport < ApplicationRecord
#   include AsyncFileProcessing
#   def process_file!
#     do_something(file.path)
#   end
# end
#
# Note: Race conditions could happen, especially if you don't prevent double clicks
# on uploads, but they should be harmless outside of performance hits.
