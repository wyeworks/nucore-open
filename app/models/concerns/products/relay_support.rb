  # this is necessary because when rails builds the attached relay
  # and merges the attributes the relay's class is either:
  #
  # 1) whatever it was before the user changed it (value of type field from db)
  # 2) Relay (the super class needed for STI) (if there was no relay attached to this instrument)
  #
  # in order to validate the relay properly we need to cast it
  # and populate self.errors ourselves
