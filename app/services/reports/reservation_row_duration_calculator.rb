    # If a reservation begins and ends within the bounds of the report, then
    # the duration should be the same as the reservation duration.
    #
    # But if a reservation began before the report start, or ends after the
    # report end, or has not ended, this should only count the part of the
    # reservation that falls within the report bounds.
    #
    # Examples with a report range of Jan 1 to 3 (259,200 seconds, or 3 days):
    #
    # * A reservation that began December 31 at noon and has not ended
    #   - The duration is 259,200 seconds (the entire report range; 3 days)
    #
    # * A reservation that began December 31 at noon and ended Jan 1 at noon
    #   - The duration is 43,200 seconds (Jan 1 midnight to noon; 12 hours)
    #
    # * A reservation that began Jan 2 at noon and has not ended
    #   - The duration is 129,600 seconds (Jan 1 noon to EOD Jan 3; 36 hours)
    #
    # * A reservation that began Jan 2 at noon and ended Jan 2 at 1:00 pm
    #   - The duration is 3600 seconds (1 hour)
