# This class defines an interface for validating
# payment source account strings. It is also the default
# for validating payment sources. As such it does
# very little. In fact, it will consider every payment
# source it validates as valid. Every real nucore instance
# should replace this class with institution-specific
# validation rules. See +ValidatorFactory+ for details
# on how to do that.
class ValidatorDefault

  #
  # Returns the payment source format that is
  # considered valid. Example: '123-456-7890'
  def self.pattern_format
    "++ any characters ++"
  end

  #
  # Returns the regexp that validates +#pattern_format+
  def self.pattern
    /.+/

  # This class will not use anything you pass in.

  # no +Exception+ if a payment source is open to new
  # payments. Otherwise a +ValidatorError+ will be raised.
