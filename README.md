# NU Core Open

Open source version of Northwestern University Core Facility Management Software

## Quickstart

Welcome to NU Core! This guide will help you get a development environment up and running. It makes a few assumptions:

1. You write code on a Mac.
2. You have a running Oracle or MySQL instance with two brand new databases.
3. You have the following installed:
    * [Ruby 2.1](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en)
    * [Bundler](http://gembundler.com)
    * [Git](http://git-scm.com)

### Spin it up

1. Download the project code from Github

    ```
    git clone git@github.com:tablexi/nucore-open.git nucore
    ```

2. Install dependencies

    ```
    cd nucore
    bundle install --without oracle
    ```

3. Configure your databases

    ```
    cp config/database.yml.mysql.template config/database.yml
    ```

    Edit the adapter, database, username, and password settings for both the development and test DBs to match your database instance

4. Create your databases

    ```
    rake db:create
    rake db:schema:load
    rake db:schema:load RAILS_ENV=test
    ```

5. Seed your development database

    ```
    rake db:seed
    rake demo:seed
    ```

6. Configure your file storage

    By default, files are stored on the local filesystem. If you wish to use
    Amazon's S3 instead, create a local settings override file such as
    `config/settings/development.local.yml` or `config/settings/production.local.yml`
    and include the following, substituting your AWS settings:

    ```
    paperclip:
      storage: fog
      fog_credentials:
        provider: AWS
        aws_access_key_id: YOUR_S3_KEY_GOES_HERE
        aws_secret_access_key: YOUR_S3_SECRET_KEY_GOES_HERE
      fog_directory: YOUR_S3_BUCKET_NAME_GOES_HERE
      fog_public: false
      path: ":class/:attachment/:id_partition/:style/:safe_filename"
    ```

7. Start your server

    ```
    bin/rails s
    ```

8. Log in

    Visit http://localhost:3000

    `demo:seed` creates several users with various permissions. All users have the default password of `password`

    | Email/username     | Role |
    | ------------------ | ---- |
    | admin@example.com  | Admin|
    | ppi123@example.com | PI   |
    | sst123@example.com | Normal User |
    | ast123@example.com | Facility Staff |
    | ddi123@example.com | Facility Director |

9. Play around! You're running NU Core!


### Test it

NU Core uses [Rspec](http://rspec.info) to run tests. Try any of the following from NU Core's root directory.

* To run all tests (this will take awhile!)
    rake spec

* To run just the model tests
    rake spec:models

* To run just the controller tests
    rake spec:controllers
