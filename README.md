# NUcore Open

Open source version of Northwestern University Core Facility Management Software

## Quickstart

Welcome to NUcore! This guide will help you get a development environment up and running. It makes a few assumptions:

1. You write code on a Mac.
2. You have a running Oracle or MySQL instance with two brand new databases. (Oracle setup instructions [here](doc/HOWTO_oracle.txt).)
3. You have the following installed:
    * [Ruby 2.4.1](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en)
    * [Bundler](http://gembundler.com)
    * [Git](http://git-scm.com)
    * [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/)

### Spin it up

1. Download the project code from Github

    ```
    git clone git@github.com:tablexi/nucore-open.git nucore
    ```

2. Install dependencies

    ```
    cd nucore
    bundle install
    ```

3. Configure your databases

    ```
    cp config/database.yml.mysql.template config/database.yml
    ```

    Edit the adapter, database, username, and password settings for both the development and test DBs to match your database instance

4. Configure your secrets

  ```
  cp config/secrets.yml.template config/secrets.yml
  rake secret
  ```

  - Paste the output from `rake secret` into `config/secrets.yml` for both `development/secret_key_base` and `test/secret_key_base`

5. Set up databases

    ```
    rake db:setup
    ```

6. Seed your development database

    ```
    rake demo:seed
    ```

7. Configure your file storage

    By default, files are stored on the local filesystem. If you wish to use
    Amazon's S3 instead, create a local settings override file such as
    `config/settings/development.local.yml` or `config/settings/production.local.yml`
    and include the following, substituting your AWS settings:

    ```
    paperclip:
      storage: fog
      fog_credentials:
        provider: AWS
        aws_access_key_id: YOUR_S3_KEY_GOES_HERE
        aws_secret_access_key: YOUR_S3_SECRET_KEY_GOES_HERE
      fog_directory: YOUR_S3_BUCKET_NAME_GOES_HERE
      fog_public: false
      path: ":class/:attachment/:id_partition/:style/:safe_filename"
    ```

8. Start your server

    ```
    bin/rails s
    ```

9. Log in

    Visit http://localhost:3000

    `demo:seed` creates several users with various permissions. All users have the default password of `password`

    | Email/username     | Role |
    | ------------------ | ---- |
    | admin@example.com  | Admin|
    | ppi123@example.com | PI   |
    | sst123@example.com | Normal User |
    | ast123@example.com | Facility Staff |
    | ddi123@example.com | Facility Director |

10. Play around! You're running NUcore!

11. Run `delayed_job` to support in-browser email previews.

    Run delayed jobs indefinitely in the background:
    ```
    ./script/delayed_job start
    ```

    Or run delayed jobs once for one-off jobs:
    ```
    ./script/delayed_job run
    ```


### Test it

NUcore uses [Rspec](http://rspec.info) to run tests. Try any of the following from NUcore's root directory.

* To run all tests (this will take awhile!)
    rake spec

* To run just the model tests
    rake spec:models

* To run just the controller tests
    rake spec:controllers


## Optional Modules

The following modules are provided as optional features via
[Rails engines](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/engines.html). These are enabled
by adding the appropriate engine to your Gemfile (all are on by default). They
exist in the `vendor/engines` directory.

* Accept Credit Cards & Purchase Orders (c2po)
* Connect to Dataprobe Power Relays (dataprobe)
* Link orders together as a Project (projects)
* [Sanger Sequencing order form and well plate management](vendor/engines/sanger_sequencing/README.md)
* [Split charges between different accounts](vendor/engines/split_accounts/README.md)
* [Authenticate against an LDAP server](vendor/engines/ldap_authentication/README.md)
* [Authenticate with SSO via SAML](vendor/engines/saml_authentication/README.md)

Engine-specific migrations should live in the engine's `db/migrate` directory and
use an engine initializer to add that path to the list of paths Rails checks. If
you need to disable an engine, you can undo all of the engine's migrations with
the `rake engines:db:migrate_down[ENGINE_NAME]` task.
