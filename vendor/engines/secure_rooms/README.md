# SecureRooms

The SecureRooms engine adds a product type supporting an access-restricted,
bill-by-time room.

## Installation

Make sure the `gem "secure_rooms", path: "vendor/engines/secure_rooms"`
line is enabled in `Gemfile`.

## SecureRoom API
The door security hardware communicates through an API with the following endpoints:

#### Cardholder Scans at a Room Entrance

* **Method/URL**
  `POST /secure_rooms_api/scan`

* **Data Params**

  * `card_number=[integer]`
  * `controller_identifier=[integer]`
  * `reader_identifier=[integer]`
  * `account_identifier=[integer]`

* **Current Responses:**

  There are three expected types of response from a properly formatted request.

  **Access Denied:** The cardholder is not currently allowed to access the SecureRoom, and they are rejected.

  * **Code:** 403 Forbidden
  * **Response:**

      ```
      { response: "deny",
        tablet_identifier: <id of associated tablet>,
        name: "Full Nameofuser",
        reason: "Reason for denial in a human-readable string" }
      ```

  **Access Granted:** We can infer the cardholder's payment method, so they are cleared immediately.

  * **Code:** 200 OK
  * **Body:**

      ```
      { response: "grant",
        tablet_identifier: <id of associated tablet>,
        name: "Full Nameofuser",
        accounts: [<list with one set of account model attributes>] }
      ```

  **Must Select Account:** The cardholder has multiple payment methods and must select which they would like to use.

  * **Code:** 300 Multiple Choices
  * **Response:**

      ```
      { response: "pending",
        tablet_identifier: <id of associated tablet>,
        name: "Full Nameofuser",
        accounts: [<list of all account model attributes>] }
      ```

  In addition, sending identifiers that do not map to existing records will generate a not found:

  **Not Found:** One of the input identifiers does not match an existing record.

  * **Code:** 404 Not Found
