## Does this change belong in open?

Some features such as authentication or financial system integration may be specific to a particular instance of NUcore. These kinds of features should be developed within their respective downstream forks. When developing these kinds of features, it is important to avoid making changes to application code (primarily /app and /lib) that also exists in the open-source fork. Otherwise, there is a high likelyhood of merge conflict if anything changes upstream.
