          This %{product_type} requires a user to be approved before they can make a 
          reservation or purchase. Users can be approved individually or a list can be imported. 
          When importing, create a CSV file with a single column titled ‘Username’ 
          (!sso_id_downcase! or email). New users are added to the existing access list.

      table:
        confirm_removal: |
          Are you sure you wish to remove this user from this %{product_type}?
