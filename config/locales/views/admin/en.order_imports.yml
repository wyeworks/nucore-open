          <p>Bulk Import orders use a CSV-formatted file.  Click %{link} to download the template.</p>
          <p>All fields are required except for %{optional_fields}.</p>
          <p>Only %{importable_products} product types can be imported.</p>
          <p>Rows containing an existing Order Number will be added to that order.</p>
          <p>Rows without an Order Number will be added as new order(s).</p>
          <p>Rows sharing the same NetID/Email, Chart String, and Order Date will be added to a single new order.</p>
