        instructions: |
          <p>Bulk imports are done by uploading a CSV formatted file (from Excel, save as “CSV (Comma delimited)”). The available fields are defined in the import template, downloadable below.</p>
          <p>All fields are required except for %{optional_fields}.</p>
          <p>Only %{importable_products} products can be imported.</p>
          <p>Rows that include an existing Order Number will be added to that order.</p>
          <p>Any rows without an Order Number will be added to a new order,
          along with any other rows with the same NetID/Email, Chart String, and Order Date.</p>
        upload_file_hint: |
          <p>Click the "Choose File" button to select the completed CSV file to upload, then click the "Import" button to add the orders to your !facility_downcase!.</p>
        fail_on_error_hint:
          <p>When checked, an import error will halt the import process entirely, allowing you to correct the file and try again.</p>
          <p>Un-check to import valid entries and return any failed entries in a CSV file for you to correct and upload later.</p>
        send_receipts_hint:
          <p>Check this box to send receipts. By default receipts are NOT sent to customers for bulk imported orders. </p>
