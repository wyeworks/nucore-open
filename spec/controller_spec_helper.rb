# This nifty method allows you to keep DRY the requests of a context.
# It relies on the following instance variables:
#
# * @method -- a +Symbol+ of a HTTP method (:get, :post, etc.)
# * @action -- the +Symbol+ of a controller action
# * @params -- a +Hash+ of requests parameters
#
# Once these instance variables are set you can call #do_request
# and the request described by the variables will be made.
# [_params_]
#   Overrides the @params variable
