# Running Oracle in Development

Follow these instructions to set up the Oracle database to run in Docker, but the app itself in your native environment.

## Setting up the Oracle Server with Docker

### Set up Docker and Oracle Container Registry (for 19c)

1. Install Docker for Mac by running `brew cask install docker`
1. Sign up for an Oracle account at <https://container-registry.oracle.com/>. If you already have an Oracle account, you can skip this step and use your existing account.
1. Select "Database" from the list of containers, then select the enterprise repository.  **This page also includes some good general documentation.**
1. On the right hand side select your language and agree to the terms and services.
1. In your terminal, make sure that docker is logged in with your Oracle credentials by running `docker login container-registry.oracle.com`.

### Set up Docker and Docker Hub (for 12c)

1. Install Docker for Mac by running `brew cask install docker`
1. Sign up for a Docker Hub account at https://hub.docker.com/. If you already have a Docker Hub account, you can skip this step and use your existing account.
1. Go to https://store.docker.com/images/oracle-database-enterprise-edition and click the button **Proceed to Checkout**. Complete and submit the form in order to get access to the free container that Oracle provides.
1. In your terminal, make sure that you are logged in with your Docker Hub credentials by running `docker login`.

### Run an Oracle service using docker-compose

You can run Oracle via docker-compose service.  Here is an example of how you might set it up:

```yaml
# docker-compose.yaml

services:
  db:
    image: container-registry.oracle.com/database/enterprise:19.3.0.0

    ports:
      - "1521:1521"
    volumes:
      - db-data:/ORCL
    logging:
      driver: none
    stdin_open: true
    tty: true
```

If you are using a computer with an apple silicon processor (M1, M2, etc) you may need to select an arm64 compatible version such as 19.19.0.0.
You can check available versions at the end of the page on step 3 of [Set up Docker and Oracle Container Registry](#Set-up-Docker-and-Oracle-Container-Registry-(for-19c))

To start the `db` service, run:

```
docker-compose up db
```

To stop the `db` service run:

```
docker-compose down
```

### Start an Oracle container

Alternately, you can run Oracle in a stand-alone docker container:

```
# Run the Oracle image as a container named oracle, storing data
# in the directory oracle/, which is ignored in git.
# When you run this for the first time, it will take a while to download
# the image and initialize the database.
#
# When the output in the terminal includes a line like:
#
#   Done ! The database is ready for use .
#
# you can use the database
docker run \
  --interactive \
  --name oracle \
  --publish 1521:1521 \
  --tty \
  --volume oracle:/ORCL \
  container-registry.oracle.com/database/enterprise:19.3.0.0
```

When you no longer need the database, in another terminal tab run:

```
docker stop oracle
```

The next time you need the database, start it just by running:

```
docker start --interactive oracle
```

## Setting up the Oracle Client Drivers

### Install Oracle Instant Client

1. Enable the homebrew tap for Oracle Instant Client by running `brew tap InstantClientTap/instantclient`.
1. Run each of these commands, following the displayed instructions for how to download the appropriate .zip files from Oracle’s website. After you download the files and place them in Homebrew’s cache directory, brew will take care of the rest:
    ```
    brew install instantclient-basic
    brew install instantclient-sqlplus
    brew install instantclient-sdk
    ```

### Set Up Environment Variables

1. Add to `~/.profile` (bash) or `~/.zprofile` (zsh)

```
# The Oracle adapter for ActiveRecord uses this password to connect as a
# system user, to be able to create and drop databases appropriately.
export ORACLE_SYSTEM_PASSWORD=Oradoc_db1

# This is used to specify the default language and encoding for Oracle clients
export NLS_LANG="AMERICAN_AMERICA.UTF8"
```

1. `source ~/.profile` or `source ~/.zprofile`, to load the changes you just made


### Test Your Installation

To connect to the Oracle server from within the `db` docker service, run:

```sql
sqlplus "sys/Oradoc_db1@(DESCRIPTION=(ADDRESS=(PROTOCOL=TCP)(HOST=localhost)(PORT=1521))(CONNECT_DATA=(SERVER=DEDICATED)(SERVICE_NAME=ORCLCDB)))" as sysdba
```

Your output should show something like this:

```
Connected to:
Oracle Database 19c Enterprise Edition Release 19.0.0.0.0 - Production
Version 19.3.0.0.0

SQL>
```

## Setting up the Database

1. Make sure you have the `activerecord-oracle_enhanced-adapter` and `ruby-oci8` gems enabled in your `Gemfile`.
1. Copy the Oracle template for `database.yml` by running `cp config/database.yml.oracle.template config/database.yml`.
1. Run `bundle exec rake db:setup`.
1. Optionally, run `bundle exec rake demo:seed` if you want to populate the database with demo data.

## Some additional notes on database setup

### Oracle error messages
Oracle error messages are often not very helpful.  For example, if you try to run `rails console` before `bundle exec rake db:setup`, you will see an error related to invalid username/password when attempting to make a query:

```bash
Loading development environment (Rails 6.0.4.4)
[1]nucore-nu(main)> User.count
OCIError: ORA-01017: invalid username/password; logon denied
from oci8.c:603:in oci8lib_260.bundle
```

The solution here is to run `rake db:setup`, nothing to do with username/password.

### Oracle image setup issues
The Oracle image can take a long time to download and initialize the first time (40+ minutes) and it also requires a lot of memory (8GB).  The logging from the oracle container is quite noisy, and error messages there usually do not indicate an actual problem.  If you encounter multiple unhelpful errors and all else fails, sometimes removing the image and starting over resolves the issue.

### Oracle database usernames
Oracle does not allow the use of "-" in database usernames.  Check your username config in `databse.yml` if you see the the following:
OCIError: ORA-00922: missing or invalid option
Couldn't create '//localhost:1521/ORCLCDB' database. Please check your configuration.

## Debugging expiring passwords

You may see an error like this when starting up the rails console:
`OCIError: ORA-28001: the password has expired`

Or when logging into sqlplus with sys user:
`ERROR: ORA-28002: the password will expire within 7 days`

Following https://blogs.oracle.com/sql/how-to-fix-ora-28002-the-password-will-expire-in-7-days-errors

... update the default user profile so that passwords don't need to be updated:
```sql
  alter profile "DEFAULT" limit
    password_life_time unlimited;

```
... then update the passwords for users you need to use for development:

`alter user <username> identified by <password>;`

```sql
  alter user sys identified by Oradoc_db1;
  alter user c##nucore_nu_development identified by password;
  alter user c##nucore_nu_test identified by password;
```

# Optional Extras

## Install Oracle SQL Developer

* Download from: `http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/developer-tools/sql-developer/overview/index.html`

* Install into `/Applications`

## Restore From Backup

1. Run `bundle exec rake db:drop db:create`. This will ensure that your database exists, and that it is empty. Without this step, the import may skip tables which already exist, and it may fail if the database does not exist.

1. Copy the `.dmp` file to `oracle/u01/app/oracle/admin/ORCL/dpdump/` (assuming you are using `oracle/` as the data directory, per above), so it is located in the server’s default data pump directory.

1. Start a bash shell in the `oracle` container:

    ```
    docker exec -it oracle bash
    ```

1. Run the following command to ensure that the file you copied is available in the `DATA_PUMP_LOCATION` configured on the server:

    ````
    ln -fsn /ORCL/u01/app/oracle/admin /u01/app/oracle/admin
    ````

  This only needs to be done once, but if you’re having trouble, rerun it.

1. Import the dump, replacing DUMPFILE with the name of your dump file, and REMAP_SCHEMA with your database’s username if necessary:

```
impdp \
  system/Oradoc_db1 \
  DIRECTORY=DATA_PUMP_DIR \
  DUMPFILE=expdp_schema_COR1PRD_201810021913.dmp \
  REMAP_SCHEMA="bc_nucore:c##nucore_open_development"
  REMAP_TABLESPACE="bc_nucore:USERS"
```


## Troubleshooting

### Known issues on Apple Silicon computers

#### Oracle instant client architecture

If you are using an arm64 architecture you may have installed an arm64 ruby version.

When running the bundle install there's the oracle gem called ruby-oci8 that requires you to have Oracle instant client locally. If you followed the [Install Oracle Instant Client](#Install-Oracle-Instant-Client) section on this readme, you have the 86x version of the Oracle instant client locally and this may cause conflicts while installing the gem. Installing the x64 version of the client does the job and allows you to install the gem but it causes issues while running the rails server.

The solution is to install ruby 86x version, unluckily reinstalling ruby with a different architecture would make your other local repositories that use the same ruby version stop working.
This issue can be solved by having 2 instances of the same ruby version but for different architectures simultaneously.

1. You are going to need Homebrew installed for both architectures so we are going to teach the terminal which Homebrew path to use depending on the current selected architecture.

Add the following code to your `~/.profile`, `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bash_profile` depending on your terminal's platform.

```
if [ "$(uname -m)" = "arm64" ]; then
  echo "arm64"
  export PATH="/opt/homebrew/bin:${PATH}"
  [ -f /opt/homebrew/bin/brew ] && eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
else
  echo "$(uname -m)"
  export PATH="/usr/local/bin:${PATH}"
  [ -f /usr/local/bin/brew ] && eval "$(/usr/local/bin/brew shellenv)"
fi
```

After saving this, every time you open a new terminal it should print the current architecture.

2. Install Homebrew in the native terminal
* This step you'll probably have it done already, if so just skip it
* Run `/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"`
  -  Make sure the root of the install is **/opt/homebrew/**


3. Install Homebrew in the x86 terminal

* First we need to change our terminal's architecture
  - Run this on your terminal `arch -x86_64 /bin/zsh`
  - The output should print "x86_64"
  - You can check your actual architecture by running `arch`, if the output is "i386" you're good to go

* Now you can install Homebrew normally
  - Run `/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"`
  - Make sure the root of the install is **/usr/local/**

4. Install Ruby version for your current architecture.

* If you had the arm64 ruby version already installed it won't allow you to install Ruby x86 with the plain rvm install command as it will detect that version is already installed.

* We need to call it a different name and make sure it uses the desired architecture.
  - Run `rvm install ruby-3.3.0 --name ruby-3.3.0-x86_64 --with-architecture=x86_64`

* Once installed make sure to use this ruby instance
  - Run `rvm use ruby-3.3.0-x86_64`

5. If ruby-oci8 doesn't find Oracle instant client installed you can install it manually and specifying the route where Oracle instant client is located.
As the Oracle instant client was installed before setting the x86 Homebrew path, it will be located at the arm64 Homebrew path.

  - Run `export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/homebrew/Cellar/instantclient-basic/19.8.0.0.0dbru/lib`
  - Run `gem install ruby-oci8 -- --with-instant-client-dir=/opt/homebrew/Cellar/instantclient-basic/19.8.0.0.0dbru`

This is an example path, please make sure to type your specific path.

### Oracle instant client folder structure

It can happen that you have Oracle instant client correctly installed but ruby-oci8 can't find specific files on the instantclient-basic folder. This happens as Oracle instant client consists of different packages and they may be stored in different folders.

Here is the fix:

1. Find the folder where instant client packages are installed

you should find the following folders:

```
instanclient-basic
instanclient-sdk
instanclient-sqlplus
instanclient-tools
```

2. Copy or move the content of the every other folder inside the instantclient-basic folder

3. Now while installing ruby-oci8 gem it should find all the files at the expected locations.
